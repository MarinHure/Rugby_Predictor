# 6 Nations Rugby Match Predictor

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I embarked on my journey into the exciting world of machine learning with my very first project two years ago. As a passionate rugby enthusiast, I saw an opportunity to combine my love for the sport with the power of machine learning. In this repository, I present my endeavor to predict the outcomes of rugby matches in the prestigious 6 Nations tournament spanning from 2005 to 2022.

Project Highlights:
- **Data Recovery**: I painstakingly gathered and organized historical data from the 6 Nations tournament, spanning nearly two decades. This data serves as the foundation for my machine learning models.

- **Data Preprocessing**: I invested significant effort into preprocessing the collected data to make it suitable for machine learning. This includes cleaning, transforming, and encoding the data to ensure it is ready for model training.

- **Regression Models**: As part of my learning journey, I experimented with various regression models to predict the results of 6 Nations rugby matches. These models leverage the historical data to make educated predictions about match outcomes.

- **Introduction to Machine Learning**: This project marks my initial foray into the world of machine learning. It represents my early attempts to understand and apply machine learning concepts and techniques to real-world data, all while indulging in my passion for rugby.

By sharing this repository, I aim to showcase my progress as a machine learning enthusiast and create a record of my journey. I welcome feedback, collaboration, and contributions from the community as I continue to develop my skills and build a portfolio to support my career aspirations.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find value in exploring my machine learning journey through the lens of the 6 Nations Rugby Match Predictor project.
